Electric skateboard from scratch-technically u know right

1.pwm to brushless dc circuit, design and solder 
2.Battery design and creation(according to motor stats) 
3.hook up to arduino, control with Analog output and comparators with motor external circuit
3.1 other devices to consider:rasberry pi(its a computer) , microbit(has accelerometer, smallest of them all, could use for remote) 
4.obtain speed control device(
4.1 handheld remote/watch clip on
4.2 physical Big buttons onboard
4.3 pressure sensor on board
4.4 accelerometer (lean forward/back) 
5.Features to consider 
5.1 safety sensor (if no human on skateboard & & skateboard on -> skateboard sets speed to 0)
5.2 headlights, could use an ldr to determine if its dark(illegal for electric vehicles to not have lights at night) 
5.3 physical breaks
5.4 ability to move backwards (bridge)
5.5 sick neon lights at bottom 
5.6 waterproofing or at least splash proofing
5.7 ability to have neutral gear, save power/(if possible charge motor) 
6. Hardware to obtain
6.1 Shannon's skateboard
6.2 track/gear to connect motor shaft to drive train of skateboard
6.3 battery and circuit mount
6.4 electrical components op amps, led, diodes, capacitors... 
7. Software 
7.1 sync control-> adruino -> motor
7.2 accelerate function
7.3 ldr function (in void loop to continuously check) 
7.4 safety feature function
7.5 try to implement library for each function for a more organised code
8. Limitations and restrictions 
8.1 weight:
8.2 cost:
8.3 dimensions:
8.4 maximum weight of load onboard to achieve 10km/h
8.5 acceleration from start
8.6 max %gradient board can climb:
8.7 max distance with <fixed load> (theoretical, actual) :(,) 
8.8 max speed with <fixed load> (theoretical, actual) :(,)
